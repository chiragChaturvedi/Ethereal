<h3> Ether: </h3> 
Referred to as 'akasha' in Sanskrit, Ether is the element that comes first in Yogic and Ayurvedic thinking. Ether is without the firmness of earth, the coolness of water, the heat of fire or even the moment of wind."                                   ~https://www.ekhartyoga.com/articles
